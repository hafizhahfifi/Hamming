# Hamming
to reach the simulation of text transmission utilizing [7, 4, 3] Hamming code, you can hit the file: [7, 4, 3]HamCode.ipynb. 
to reach the simulation of incorrect decoding probability, you can hit the file: incorrect-decoding-prob.ipynb.
disclaimer: the simulation works in Jupyter Notebook SageMath version 9.3.
