# Hamming
to reach the simulation of text transmission utilizing [7, 4, 3] Hamming code, you can hit the file: [7, 4, 3]HamCode.ipynb. <br>
to reach the simulation of correct decoding probability, you can hit the file: correct-decoding-prob.ipynb. <br>
<br>
disclaimer: the simulation works in Jupyter Notebook SageMath version 9.3.
